# 🎧 3D Sound Journey Builder

> vibecoded with ❤️ by **LeopardCode.AI** — built through agentic coding with Chinese AI models (Qwen3.6 Plus), zero project structure tools, one conversation at a time.

## 🎧 What it does

An interactive **spatial sound experience builder** running entirely in the browser. Place instruments, nature sounds, and ambient textures on a 2D/3D canvas — each with its own position in space, volume, height, and animation path. Design multi-minute sound journeys with keyframe-based spatial animation, then export and share.

Every sound source renders as it would be experienced **inside your head**: HRTF spatialization with personalized head/shoulder/pinna modeling, posture physics (standing, lying-back, lateral), and real-time AirPods head tracking via WebBLE.

## 🧠 How it was built

```
User intent → Qwen3.6 Plus agent → code → test → deploy → repeat

| Layer | Stack |
|-------|-------|
| **Spatial Audio** | Web Audio API, HRTF convolution, custom HRIR tables, PannerNode |
| **3D Canvas** | Canvas 2D with isometric projection, particle fog, ripple physics |
| **Timeline** | Keyframe interpolation (linear/ease-in/ease-out), zoomable ruler |
| **State Mgmt** | Command Pattern (UndoManager), Map-based source registry |
| **Audio Engine** | Manual AudioContext graph, gain ramping, stereo L/R metering |
| **Head Tracking** | WebBLE + AirPods IMU → quaternion → listener rotation |
| **UI** | Glass-morphism sidebar, vibe glass design system |
| **Testing** | Vitest + jsdom, 104 unit tests across 7 modules |
| **Deploy** | Vite → Vercel edge |

### The vibe coding philosophy

- **No project scaffolding** — `npm init` was the only boilerplate
- **No architecture diagrams** — structure emerged from feature conversations
- **No Jira/Linear/ClickUp** — the AI agent WAS the project manager
- **Chinese models (Qwen3.6 Plus)** handled 100% of code generation
- **Agentic loop**: the AI inspected its own output via Playwright, found bugs (invalid RGBA strings, missing timeline sync), and self-corrected
- **Human role**: intent definition, vibe checks, final approval clicks

## 🧪 The AI Self-Testing Loop

One of the wildest parts of this experiment: the AI agent **inspected its own output**. When the canvas was rendering black, it:

1. Installed Playwright on its own
2. Wrote test scripts to screenshot the live app
3. Discovered the `addColorStop` error (invalid RGBA `(0, 153, 255, 0.8, 0.15)`)
4. Traced it to a `.replace()` chain on already-alpha colors
5. Created a `_withAlpha()` helper handling hex → rgba → alpha-replace
6. Tested, verified, and deployed — all autonomously

## ⚠️ AI Experiment Disclaimer

This project was built as an **experiment in agentic AI coding**. Expect:

- Files that grew organically (some are 500+ lines — the agent just kept adding)
- Creative naming conventions (German + English mixed freely)
- Architecture decisions that "just worked" rather than being "best practice"
- A vibe-based design system that evolved through conversation
- Zero centralized state management (it's all in the AudioContext graph)

The point was never clean code — it was seeing how far an AI agent could go with nothing but intent and a feedback loop.
